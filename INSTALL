Rafkill

* Installation:

If you just want to build rafkill immediately and play it, run the 
build-rafkill.sh script:

	$ ./build-rafkill.sh
	OR
	$ sh build-rafkill.sh

If you want to have finer control over the build process read the following:

Rafkill uses scons( http://www.scons.org ) to build. The makefile just calls scons.

$ scons
OR
$ make

$ scons install
OR
$ make install

You can specify two parameters to the build system which determine where files end up upon installation. You can only do this with scons, not make.
	prefix=/some/path
	bin=/some/path/bin

Prefix is the root directory where the data files will end up. Example:
	$ scons prefix=/home/myuser/games
	$ scons install
	$ ls /home/myuser/games
	rafkill/

Prefix defaults to /usr/local/games. 

*NOTE*: If you dont want to install rafkill anywhere and just run it from the 
directory where the source is then set prefix to some arbitrary directory name:
	$ mkdir x
	$ scons prefix=x
	$ scons install
	$ ./rafkill

Also unless you use '.' for prefix you should always use absolute paths, not relative ones.
	$ scons prefix=/usr/stuff/games  ## Right!
	$ scons prefix=../../games       ## Wrong!

In truth, relative directories will work as long as you run it from the same directory you ran
'scons install' from. This will not work as soon as you change directories, though.
	$ scons prefix=../../games
	$ scons install
	$ rafkill       ## ok, we are still in the same directory
	$ cd ..         ## go somewhere else
	$ rafkill       ## wont work

You could use a relative directory and wrap rafkill in a shell script that cd's to the proper
directory. The choice is yours. Well heres an example shell script to do that anyway:
	## assuming rafkill was built with 'prefix=./games' at /home/myuser/tmp
	## then /home/myuser/tmp/games/rafkill was moved to /home/myuser/local/games
	#!/bin/sh
	RAFKILL_DIR=/home/myuser/local/games
	cd $RAFKILL_DIR/..
	$RAFKILL_DIR/rafkill/rafkill

Bin is the directory where a symbolic link to the rafkill binary will end up. The entire
rafkill distrobution will be in $prefix/rafkill including the binary and a symlink is made from
$prefix/rafkill/rafkill to $bin/rafkill. Example:
	$ scons prefix=/home/myuser/games bin=/home/myuser/bin
	$ scons install
	$ ls -l /home/myuser/bin
	rafkill -> /home/myuser/games/rafkill/rafkill

Bin defaults to /usr/local/bin

* Cleanup:

$ scons -c
OR
$ make clean

If you installed rafkill somewhere then the entire package will be in that directory. Therefore
if you want to erase rafkill from your system all you have to do is erase that directory. You 
should probably also remove the symlink in the bin directory, but it wont kill you to leave that there. Example:
	$ scons prefix=/home/myuser/games bin=/home/myuser/bin   ## Build rafkill
	$ scons install                ## Install it
	$ /home/myuser/bin/rafkill     ## Play the game
	## Man, rafkill sucks!
	$ rm -rf /home/myuser/games/rafkill  ## Erase rafkill
	$ unlink /home/myuser/bin/rafkill    ## Remove symlink
